        <br><p><b>Hi, I'm Nebs, and I play CS2. This guide will teach you how to get what you really want out of this game. If you want to be so good that people think you are cheating, <br>then follow this guide to a T.

      <br><h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <h3>Cheats</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, the only way to truly be good at this game is to cheat, everyone does it, and if you don't do it, then clearly you're ass.</p>
        <p>So get to downloading your favorite "aimbot" and "wallhacks" and slay out on these tryhard bitches! <img class="walls" src="walls.gif"></p>
 
      <h3>Jiggle Peek</h3>
        <p>Jiggle jiggle jiggle, if you arent jiggle peeking, and pre aiming those corners with your new cheats, then you must be a retard. <br>I want you to jiggle that corner so fast, that it breaks the sound barrier. Jiggle like a fat bitch when she is walking down the stairs!<img class="jiggle" src="jiggle.gif"></p>
  
       <h3>Pass to the FUCKING Right</h3>
        <p>Brother, I can not stress this one enough. When we start the round, you will pass to the fucking right of my body, or anyones body you are faced with. <br> I don't give a damn how left leaning your gay ass politics are, pass to the right or we are gonna have a problem. My Uncle owns Valve, and I will have your account <br>perma-banned so god damn fast if you dont follow this simple step.</p>
